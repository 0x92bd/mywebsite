In this article I will share my experience bulding my personal portfolio/blog website using Hugo. Hugo is an static site generator. Unlike CMS like wordpress, Static site does not render webpages dinamicaly, it just hosts pre-compiled webpages to the users. So, static sites can be extremly fast, secure, easy to maintain.

Hugo uses markdown to edit posts. So just by learning markdown you can write your blogs with ease.

## Hugo
To install hugo on arch based system:
```
sudo pacman -S hugo
```

## Setup github repo

## Setup cloudflare pages
